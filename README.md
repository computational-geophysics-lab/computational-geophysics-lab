## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to the [Computational Geophysics Lab](https://computational-geophysics-lab.github.io/cgl.github.io/) at [Nanyang Technological University](https://www.ntu.edu.sg) (NTU) and the [Earth Observatory of Singapore](https://earthobservatory.sg) (EOS). Our team leverages cutting-edge physics-based simulations to tackle key challenges in Geohazards and Geoenergy systems monitoring. We focus on addressing societal-scale issues, including large destructive earthquakes, predicting strong ground motion, estimating long-term seismic hazards, and assessing the potential for induced seismicity during anthropogenic activities such as geothermal exploration and CO2 sequestration.
